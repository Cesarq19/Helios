# Project Submission

### HELIOS
Team Name: Solar Coders
App Name: Helios

### High-Level Project Summary
We developed an interactive movil app to help the general public to understand the information about the solar wind and its effects on the Earth, we provide them with visual and sound experience of how space would be. In addition we implemented a prototype linked to the app that will help the user to know in real time how much our geomagnetic field in the Earth is affected by the energy of the sun. With our app and device we look forward to attract the interest of many people into the space world.

### Detailed Project Description

Proporcione detalles adicionales sobre su proyecto.

- **¿Qué hace exactamente?**

Our project consists of an interactive app that allows users to know important data about the sun and how it influences space and terrestrial weather with the guidance of a fictional character who will act as a guide and provide short descriptions to arouse the interest of users. as well as giving basic indications so that the user correctly understands each of the data, which were obtained from the NASA database about the solar wind and the index of magnetic disturbance exerted by the sun when geomagnetic storms occur. While as a complement, the geomagnetic disturbance index data was linked and represented as a traffic light so that the user can recognize in real time how these events affect telecommunications and services that are outside the Earth's orbit.
    
- **¿Cómo funciona?**
    it explains the information that is collected about the solar wind and its effects with  senses such as view and sounds throught the analysis  of this data with purpose of giving  interesting facts about this data ,reprensenting the temperature  of the solar wind as a sound , also being able to see the intensity of the interference of solar explosion on the earth throught a visual experienc with a rgb bulb using a wifi module sp32.
   
    
- **¿Qué beneficios tiene?**
    ayuda a la gente a entender acerca del universo en el que vivimos a
    
- **¿Qué esperas lograr?**
    motivate the population to know about the  interesting that can be the  universe and the diferents ways in wich we can understand it and analize it , also the app helps us to understand in a interesting and funnt way the marverlous that ours universe can be without the worries of understanding complexity of the data .
   
    
- **Qué herramientas, lenguajes de codificación.**
    we used diverse tools as python  and libraries as matplotliba, pandas , numpy and pygame to obtain,treat, filter and normalize  the data for  the process of sonification to turn the data of the temperature on real time into music . 
    we used c++ to obtain data about the kp index and its effects on the earth to conect it to a wifi module sp32 and with this  show throught a rgb bulb the intensity of the magnitud of the rgb .
    we used figma website to design the  application layouts and canvas to get all character designs .
    Also using android studio to build the app .

### Space Agency Data


Thanks to Helmholtz Centre Potsdam (German Research Centre for Geosciences) we use realtime Kp indexes and build a prototype with the idea to be a physical indicator of the intensity of perturbances that affects the magnetic field on Earth. For this, we used an online simulator called Wokwi to work with the ESP32 microcontroller, we connected it to the internet and recollect the information about the Kp, which is updated every 3 hours and so our rgb led that visually (using semaphore parameters) helps the user know how much our magnectic field is affected by the sun and provide the experience to be part of the Nasa team from their homes.

### Hackathon Journey

- **How would you describe your Space Apps experience?**
    At the beginning we were uncertain about which project we should choose because it was our first time to join such a huge event. Through out the challenge we faced some difficulties like no internet conection during the first day but above that we complete succesfully what we proposed as the solution to the challenge. 
    
- **What did you learn?**
    We learn the importance of group work and to respect
